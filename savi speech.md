Good afternoon judges! I'm excited to show you how we're revolutionizing knowledge transfer in government with our Digital Twin Platform.

"Let me start with our dashboard - this is what employees see when they log in.

The beauty here is that this isn't just a static repository - it's a living knowledge ecosystem where expertise flows naturally between colleagues.

"Now, here's where the magic happens - creating your digital twin. We've made it incredibly simple with three options:

First, 'Policy Process Video' - employees can record their screen while walking through complex procedures. Imagine capturing 20 years of EU directive expertise in a 30-minute video!

[Select different options] Second, 'Templates & Checklists' - because let's be honest, half of government work is filling out the right forms in the right order. [smile]

And third, 'Expertise Profile' - this is where people document their specialized knowledge. Look at these expertise areas: 'Brexit Financial Impact', 'Digital Euro Development' - these are real, current challenges that the Ministry faces.

[Point to security section] Notice our compliance section - we're not just throwing documents into the cloud and hoping for the best. Everything is properly classified and GDPR compliant. Because the last thing we need is a data breach making headlines!"

"This is our centralized knowledge bank

[Show search functionality] Employees can search across all documents, procedures, and expertise. 
No more sending emails asking 'Does anyone know how to handle EU state aid applications?'

[Select different topics] Look at these knowledge areas - from EU legislation to ESG reporting. E
ach topic has policy documents, training videos, and practical tools.

[Point to expert contacts] And here's something special - direct contact to subject matter experts. 

Dr. Sarah Mitchell for EU Legislation, Lisa Chen for Digital Finance. Real people with real expertise, just a phone call away. It's like having a government Rolodex, but digital and actually organized!"
