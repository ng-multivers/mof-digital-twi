        "situation": "You are a Senior Policy Advisor. The minister asks for an urgent impact assessment and implementation strategy.",
        "options": [
            "Immediately start stakeholder consultation with business sector",

        "situation": "You advise on state aid possibilities within EU state aid rules. What is your first step?",
        "options": [
            "Directly grant state aid - the sector is critical",

        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "State aid rules are strictly regulated by the EU. Consultation with the Commission prevents legal problems and ensures compliant support for the financial sector."
    },
    
    "Digital Euro Decision": {
        "context": "The ECB asks member states for input on digital euro implementation. DNB and ministry must respond jointly.",
        "situation": "Different departments have conflicting visions. How do you coordinate the Dutch position?",
        "options": [
            "Let DNB take the lead - they are the experts",

            "Joint working group with clear mandates per organization"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "Digital euro affects both monetary policy (DNB) and fiscal/regulatory policy (Ministry). Joint approach with clear role division is essential."

        "options": [
            "Immediately organize a press conference to reassure the sector",
            "First conduct legal analysis and then respond",
            "Activate crisis team: parallel legal analysis + stakeholder consultation + communication strategy",

        "situation": "You must formulate a ministerial position within 48 hours.",
        "options": [
            "Say yes - innovation is important for the Netherlands",
            "Say no - too many risks for Dutch banks",
            "Conditional yes: only with strict privacy safeguards and compensation mechanisms for banks",
            "Pass to next cabinet - too complex for quick decision"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "Digital euro pilot offers opportunities but has real risks. Conditional agreement shows leadership while protecting Dutch interests through privacy rules and bank compensation."

            "Bilateral consultation with Ireland to prevent 'race to the bottom'"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "State aid rules are strict, but there are legal ways such as R&D and training subsidies. This protects jobs while remaining EU compliant and preventing precedent."
    },
    
    "ESG Reporting Resistance": {
